        ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Pragya â€” a curious builder who loves turning UX problems into clean, efficient
        interfaces. I enjoy working at the intersection of design and engineering: optimizing
        performance, automating workflows (especially with ServiceNow), and crafting apps that
        people actually enjoy using.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-3 leading-relaxed">
        I value readable code, pragmatic architecture, and thoughtful UX. Outside work I tinker with
        tools that save time, experiment with new JS patterns, and collect developer tricks I can
        bring back to the team.
